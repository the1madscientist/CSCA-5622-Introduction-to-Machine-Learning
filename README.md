Welcome to the Starship Titanic ML Project! This repository contains my final project for CSCA 5622 Introduction to machine learning, supervised learning.
I have decided to join a Kaggle competition classifying data centered around the mysterious voyage of the Starship Titanic. The challenge here is to build
a classification model that predicts which passengers were transported through a wormhole to another galaxy and which ones perished during the accident. 
By leveraging machine learning techniques, I aim to analyze the provided dataset to uncover patterns and build an effective predictive model for this 
captivating scenario. Dive in to explore the code, methods, and insights gained throughout my journey!, I hope you enjoy!

Introduction

Durring my time here working on this classification problem, I hope to utilize the knowledge gained from my coursework on supervised learning to create
a model, or multiple models to classify the data in the problem set. I will then submit myself to to competition to measure my progress against the field 
of competitiors. 

For context, and a problem outline, here is an excert from the kaggle competition description page:

Welcome to the year 2912, where your data science skills are needed to solve a cosmic mystery. We've received a transmission from four lightyears away and 
things aren't looking good.

The Spaceship Titanic was an interstellar passenger liner launched a month ago. With almost 13,000 passengers on board, the vessel set out on its maiden 
voyage transporting emigrants from our solar system to three newly habitable exoplanets orbiting nearby stars.

While rounding Alpha Centauri en route to its first destination—the torrid 55 Cancri E—the unwary Spaceship Titanic collided with a spacetime anomaly hidden
within a dust cloud. Sadly, it met a similar fate as its namesake from 1000 years before. Though the ship stayed intact, almost half of the passengers were 
transported to an alternate dimension!

To help rescue crews and retrieve the lost passengers, you are challenged to predict which passengers were transported by the anomaly using records recovered
from the spaceship’s damaged computer system.

Help save them and change history!


Dataset Overview

Data Preprocessing

Explain the steps taken to clean and preprocess the data, such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

Feature Engineering

Describe the feature engineering process, including any new features created, feature selection, and rationale behind these decisions.

Model Selection

Discuss the different models considered for the classification task, including why certain models were chosen or discarded. Mention any hyperparameter tuning performed.

Training and Evaluation

Provide details on how the models were trained, evaluation metrics used, and validation techniques applied (e.g., cross-validation).

Results

Summarize the performance of the final model(s) and discuss the results, including metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Conclusion

Conclude with key takeaways from the project, including insights gained and the overall effectiveness of the model.

Future Work
